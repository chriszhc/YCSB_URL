YCSB_URL
========
Currently, this repo does not have any data file or itermmediate files, since those workloads depend on the specific
use of YCSB, and some data is too huge to fit in Git hub.

So, we have a sample 1 million raw urls store at https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14532517/large_urls_1M.txt,
and you can download it, and put it into urls folder, change generate scripts, you are good to go :)
